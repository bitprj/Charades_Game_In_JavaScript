# Charades_Game_In_JavaScript
Quarantine life has been bored without hanging out with friends and buying boba. Everyone is desperate to have some fun at home. I recently read a post about creating a [memery game using Vanilla JavaScript by Marina Ferreira](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/vanilla-javascript-tutorial-build-a-memory-game-in-30-minutes-e542c4447eae), and found the techniques she used are very interesting, so I decided to create another popular game - Charades, using similar techniques and adding more features. You would dive a little more into some JavaScript methods in this tutorial. Let's get start to build our own charades game while learning HTML/CSS and JavaScript together in this one hour!
